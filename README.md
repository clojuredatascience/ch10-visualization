Example code for chapter ten, [Clojure for Data Science](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/clojure-data-science).

## Data

Some of the data for this chapter has been sourced by the [Complex Systems Research Group at the Medical University of Vienna](http://www.complex-systems.meduniwien.ac.at/elections/election.html). See [Chapter 1's README](https://github.com/clojuredatascience/ch1-statistics/blob/master/README.md) for more information about this data and how to download it.

Other data has been sourced from the article ["Wealth, Income and Power" by G. William Domhoff](http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html), and ["Building a Better America−−One Wealth Quintile at a Time" by Michael I. Norton and Dan Ariely](http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20ariely%20in%20press.pdf). It's not necessary to download this data: numbers are included directly in the source code.
